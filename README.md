Team Contribution
I communicated changes to the team through Slack and Trello.

I also paired with the Front End Architect to go over the application and then I contributed to the React App by forking the repo, adding styles through Material UI, and then creating a pull request to merge my changes back into the React App (link here).

I created my own design and used proper positition and layout techniques including the flexbox on the site.

LESS was used to organize my code and make it easier to read and digest for another developer.

Responsive units (REMS) were used for font-sizing and the site looks professional at 1000px and above.

I designed both the home page and about page for this site and I also chose the font stack, colors and images for the site.
